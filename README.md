Bee is a command line utility for Backdrop CMS. It includes commands that allow
developers to interact with Backdrop sites, performing actions like:

- Running cron
- Clearing caches
- Downloading and installing Backdrop
- Downloading, enabling and disabling projects
- Viewing information about a site and/or available projects

See the Release notes and the Changelog for details of changes between
versions.

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/linux-blue?logo=linux&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-blue?logo=apple&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/WSL2-blue?logo=linux&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)

- Bee will work in most Linux based environments.
- Bee will NOT work natively in Windows but can be used inside Linux based
virtual environments such as WSL2.
- Bee requires the `mysql` and `mysqldump` executables to be installed for most
database operations (i.e. `db-export`, `db-import`, `db-drop`, `sql` but NOT
`db-query`).

### PHP

- Bee is tested and works from `7.4` up to `8.2`. It may work on `8.3`; if you
try and find errors, please report in the issue queue.

## Installation

- Download (or clone) Bee to your computer/server.  
  This will create a folder called `bee` with lots of files inside. Your home
  directory is a good location for this folder. It is neither required nor
  recommended to place this folder within the Backdrop web root.

- Make sure `bee/bee.php` is executable.  
  It should be by default, but it doesn't hurt to double-check.

- Make it easy to run `bee` commands.  
  There are two ways to do this:

  1. Put a symlink to `bee/bee.php` in your `$PATH` (e.g.
     `sudo ln -s /path/to/bee/bee.php /usr/local/bin/bee`)

  2. Make a Bash alias for `bee` (e.g. add `alias bee='/path/to/bee/bee.php'` to
     your `.bash_aliases` file)

- Test to make sure it works.  
  Simply type `bee` in your terminal and you should see a list of available
  commands displayed.

More advanced/specialised installation instructions can be found in the
[wiki](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bee/wiki).

## Extending

Bee can be extended (i.e. custom/additional commands added) by Backdrop contrib
modules or by individual users. See
[API.md](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bee/blob/1.x-1.x/API.md) for
details.

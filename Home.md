# Introduction to Bee

Bee is a command line utility for Backdrop CMS. It includes commands that allow
developers to interact with Backdrop sites, performing actions like:

- Running cron
- Clearing caches
- Downloading and installing Backdrop
- Downloading, enabling and disabling projects
- Viewing information about a site and/or available projects

Please note that Bee is under active development and, as such, **breaking
changes may occur**. Please see the release notes for a list of any major
changes between versions. Also note that Bee is not (yet?) compatible with
Microsoft Windows.
